# Guessing-the-number-game-in-simple-python
The code in the game above is very simple and non-structural. You are welcome to contribute in the code and update it in the form of classes and proper structure. Your efforts shall really be appreciated. This is for the beginners so that they could see the working code in unstructured form and then give it Object Oriented shape by updating the code. I have made logic very simple and straight forward. Just start reading the code from the bottom life as the main function, also mentioned in comment, and see what values are passing to functions and which function. This will surely help you to understand the pattern and flow of code. If you still have problem in understanding the code, you can share it in "Issues" tab or contact me on "syedalizain03@gmail.com" or my Twitter, Insta, LinkedIn, Facebook as @syedalizain033. Thank you.
